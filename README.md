## Getting started
1. Clone this repository: `
   https://github.com/snowywombat/Capstone-Project.git
   `

2. Install dependencies

      ```bash
      pipenv install -r requirements.txt
      ```

3. Create a **.env** file based on the example with proper settings for your
   development environment
   - Example
   
   ```js
   SECRET_KEY=super-secret-key
   FLASK_ENV=development
   FLASK_DEBUG=True
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///dev.db
   SCHEMA=capstone_schema
   FLASK_RUN_PORT=5001
   ```

4. Make sure the SQLite3 database connection URL is in the **.env** file

5. This starter organizes all tables inside the `flask_schema` schema, defined
   by the `SCHEMA` environment variable.  Replace the value for
   `SCHEMA` with a unique name, **making sure you use the snake_case
   convention**.

6. Get into your pipenv, migrate your database, seed your database, and run your Flask app

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

   ```bash
   flask seed all
   ```

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

7. To run the React App in development, checkout the [README](./react-app/README.md) inside the `react-app` directory.
